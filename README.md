# Creating our Developer Portfolio
Week 2 challenge is creating our first portfolio page.

## Description

I want to create a portfolio of my deployed webpages to improve my employability. Setting up the portfolio now will help me realize my progress and is a valuable tool to share my findings with fellow students.


### CSS
- Work with flex and grid.
- Application's CSS file is properly commented.
- Added Media Queries 

### HTML

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
-

## Usage

https://lisamlorenz.github.io/portfolio_lisa_lorenz/

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
// Note: this wasn't full-filled

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

// Note: this was partly full-filled, some of the objects overlap.
